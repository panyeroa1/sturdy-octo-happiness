Title: Fix Translation Sidebar History Overwrite
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:00

Current behavior:

- Translation sidebar transcripts appear "broken" or flash/disappear because new segments from non-cumulative STT engines (like Deepgram) overwrite previous ones instead of appending.

Plan and scope:

- Modify `setTranscriptions` logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx` to handle both cumulative (WebSpeech) and chunked (Deepgram) inputs.
- Implement intelligent appending/replacing based on text overlap.

Files expected to change:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

END LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 13:10

Summary of what actually changed:

- Updated `setTranscriptions` state update logic in `PageClientImpl.tsx`.

- This ensures history is preserved for 1-second chunks from Deepgram while supporting cumulative updates from WebSpeech.

Files actually modified:

- app/rooms/[roomName]/PageClientImpl.tsx

How it was tested:

- npm run build (Verified clean build)
- npm run lint (Verified code quality)

Title: Segment-based Transcription Storage refactor
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 15:45

Current behavior:

END LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 15:46

- Step 1: Source arrival triggers 'render-source' event.
- Step 2: 'render-source' updates UI and triggers 'translate' event.
- Step 3: 'translate' updates UI and triggers 'tts' event.
- Step 4: 'tts' updates audio queue.

Title: Optimized Sentence-Level Segmentation for Fast Pace
Status: DONE
Owner: Miles

START LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 17:25

Current behavior:
- Transcription processing waits for the browser's slow `isFinal` event.
- Large blocks of text are processed at once, delaying TTS.

Plan and scope:
- Implement `splitIntoSentences` utility in `PageClientImpl.tsx`.
- Refactor `handleTranscriptSegment` and participants' listener to process each sentence separately.
- Enhance `LiveCaptions.tsx` with "pseudo-final" emissions based on silence (>800ms).

END LOG

Timestamp: 2026-01-04 17:55

Summary:
- Optimized the entire transcription pipeline to handle text at the sentence level.
- Reduced perceived latency for TTS by triggering it immediately after each sentence.
- Improved responsiveness with silence-based pseudo-final emissions.
- Fixed TypeScript `Intl.Segmenter` and dependency warnings.

How it was tested:
- npm run build (Pass)
- Sequential code review of the segmentation logic.

Test result:

- Implement audio device enumeration in `OrbitApp.tsx`.
- Add `audioDevices` and `selectedDeviceId` state.
- Update `TranslatorDock.tsx` to include a device selection UI.
- Update all `getUserMedia` calls to respect the chosen `deviceId`.

Files or modules expected to change:
- lib/orbit/OrbitApp.tsx
